## Basic usage

### Using the container

The `container` className sets the `max-width` of an element to match the `min-width` of the current breakpoint. This is useful if you'd prefer to design for a fixed set of screen sizes instead of trying to accommodate a fully fluid viewport.

Note that unlike containers you might have used in other frameworks, **Tailwind's container does not center itself automatically and does not have any built-in horizontal padding.**

To center a container, use the `mx-auto` utility:

```html
<div className="container **mx-auto**">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

To add horizontal padding, use the `px-{size}` utilities:

```html
<div className="container mx-auto **px-4**">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

If you'd like to center your containers by default or include default horizontal padding, see the [customization options](#customizing) below.
