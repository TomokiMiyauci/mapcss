## Basic usage

### Setting the break-after behavior

Use the `break-after-{value}` utilities to control how a column or page break should behave after an element. For example, use the `break-after-column` utility to force a column break after an element.

```html
<div className="columns-2">
  <p>Well, let me tell you something, ...</p>
  <p className="**break-after-column**">Sure, go ahead, laugh...</p>
  <p>Maybe we can live without...</p>
  <p>Look. If you think this is...</p>
</div>
```
