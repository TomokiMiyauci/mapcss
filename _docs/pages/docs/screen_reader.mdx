## Basic usage

### Screen-reader-only elements

Use `sr-only` to hide an element visually without hiding it from screen readers:

```html
<a href="#">
  <svg><!-- ... --></svg>
  <span className="sr-only">Settings</span>
</a>
```

### Undoing screen-reader-only elements

Use `not-sr-only` to undo `sr-only`, making an element visible to sighted users as well as screen readers. This can be useful when you want to visually hide something on small screens but show it on larger screens for example:

```html
<a href="#">
  <svg><!-- ... --></svg>
  <span className="sr-only sm:not-sr-only">Settings</span>
</a>
```
