## Basic usage

### Normal

Use `break-normal` to only add line breaks at normal word break points.

<Example p="none">
  <div className="overflow-x-scroll sm:overflow-x-visible px-4">
    <div className="mx-auto max-w-sm bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-500 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
      <p className="break-normal">
        The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is
        <span className="text-slate-900 font-medium dark:text-slate-200">pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</span>
        a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation
        of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it
        is the same as silicosis.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<p className="**break-normal** ...">...</p>
```

### Break Words

Use `break-words` to add line breaks mid-word if needed.

<Example p="none">
  <div className="px-4">
    <div className="mx-auto max-w-sm bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-500 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
      <p className="break-words">
        The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is
        <span className="text-slate-900 font-medium dark:text-slate-200">pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</span>
        a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation
        of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it
        is the same as silicosis.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<p className="**break-words** ...">...</p>
```

### Break All

Use `break-all` to add line breaks whenever necessary, without trying to preserve whole words.

<Example p="none">
  <div className="px-4">
    <div className="mx-auto max-w-sm bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-500 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
      <p className="break-all">
        The longest word in any of the major English language dictionaries is
        <span className="text-slate-900 font-medium dark:text-slate-200">pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</span>
        a word that refers to a lung disease contracted from the inhalation
        of very fine silica particles, specifically from a volcano; medically, it
        is the same as silicosis.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<p className="**break-all** ...">...</p>
```
