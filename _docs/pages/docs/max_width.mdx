## Basic usage

### Setting the maximum width

Set the maximum width of an element using the `max-w-{size}` utilities.

<Example resizable>
  <div className="overflow-hidden relative max-w-md mx-auto bg-white shadow-lg ring-1 ring-black/5 rounded-xl flex items-center gap-6 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:highlight-white/5">
    <img
      className="absolute -left-6 w-28 h-28 rounded-full shadow-lg"

    />
    <div className="min-w-0 py-5 pl-28 pr-5">
      <div className="text-slate-900 font-medium text-sm sm:text-base truncate dark:text-slate-200">
        Andrew Alfred
      </div>
      <div className="text-slate-500 font-medium text-sm sm:text-base leading-tight truncate dark:text-slate-400">
        Assistant to the Traveling Secretary
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<div className="**max-w-md** ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### Reading width

The `max-w-prose` utility gives an element a max-width optimized for readability and adapts based on the font size.

<Example>
  <div className="space-y-8">
    <div>
      <span className="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3">
        text-sm
      </span>
      <div className="max-w-prose text-sm font-medium text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        <p>
          Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where
          the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing.
          I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the
          tops.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span className="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3">
        text-base
      </span>
      <div className="max-w-prose text-base font-medium text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        <p>
          Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where
          the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing.
          I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the
          tops.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span className="font-medium text-sm text-slate-500 font-mono mb-3">
        text-xl
      </span>
      <div className="max-w-prose text-xl font-medium text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
        <p>
          Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where
          the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing.
          I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the
          tops.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<div className="text-sm **max-w-prose** ...">
  <p>
    Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the
    muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell
    you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="text-base **max-w-prose** ...">
  <p>
    Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the
    muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell
    you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
  </p>
</div>

<div className="text-xl **max-w-prose** ...">
  <p>
    Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the
    muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of does it's own thing. I'll tell
    you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
  </p>
</div>
```

### Constraining to your breakpoints

The `max-w-screen-{breakpoint}` classes can be used to give an element a max-width matching a specific breakpoint. These values are automatically derived from the [`theme.screens` section](/docs/theme#screens) of your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```html
<div className="max-w-screen-2xl">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
