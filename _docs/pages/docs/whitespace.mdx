## Basic usage

### Normal

Use `whitespace-normal` to cause text to wrap normally within an element. Newlines and spaces will be collapsed.

<Example p="none">
  <div className="bg-white p-8 shadow-xl text-slate-700 max-w-md mx-auto overflow-auto text-sm leading-6 sm:text-base sm:leading-7 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div className="whitespace-normal">Hey everyone! It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You will never know.</div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<div className="w-3/4 ...">
  <div className="**whitespace-normal** ...">
    Hey everyone! It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens
    living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You
    will never know.
  </div>
</div>
```

### No Wrap

Use `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text from wrapping within an element. Newlines and spaces will be collapsed.

<Example p="none">
  <div className="bg-white px-6 py-8 shadow-xl text-slate-700 max-w-md mx-auto overflow-auto text-sm leading-6 sm:text-base sm:leading-7 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div className="whitespace-nowrap">Hey everyone! It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You will never know.</div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<div className="w-3/4 overflow-x-auto ...">
  <div className="**whitespace-nowrap** ...">
    Hey everyone! It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens
    living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You
    will never know.
  </div>
</div>
```

### Pre

Use `whitespace-pre` to preserve newlines and spaces within an element. Text will not be wrapped.

<Example p="none">
  <div className="bg-white px-6 py-8 shadow-xl text-slate-700 max-w-md mx-auto overflow-auto text-sm leading-6 sm:text-base sm:leading-7 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div className="whitespace-pre">
      Hey everyone!
      <br />
        It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens living among
        us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.
      <br />
      You will never know.
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<div className="w-3/4 overflow-x-auto ...">
  <div className="**whitespace-pre** ...">
    Hey everyone! It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens
    living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You
    will never know.
  </div>
</div>
```

### Pre Line

Use `whitespace-pre-line` to preserve newlines but not spaces within an element. Text will be wrapped normally.

<Example p="none">
  <div className="bg-white px-6 py-8 shadow-xl text-slate-700 max-w-md mx-auto overflow-auto text-sm leading-6 sm:text-base sm:leading-7 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div className="whitespace-pre-line">
      Hey everyone!
      <br />
        It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens living among
        us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.
      <br />
      You will never know.
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<div className="w-3/4 ...">
  <div className="**whitespace-pre-line** ...">
    Hey everyone! It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens
    living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You
    will never know.
  </div>
</div>
```

### Pre Wrap

Use `whitespace-pre-wrap` to preserve newlines and spaces within an element. Text will be wrapped normally.

<Example p="none">
  <div className="bg-white px-6 py-8 shadow-xl text-slate-700 max-w-md mx-auto overflow-auto text-sm leading-6 sm:text-base sm:leading-7 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <div className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
      Hey everyone!
      <br />
        It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens living among
        us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.
      <br />
      You will never know.
    </div>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<div className="w-3/4 ...">
  <div className="**whitespace-pre-wrap** ...">
    Hey everyone! It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there is aliens
    living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien. You
    will never know.
  </div>
</div>
