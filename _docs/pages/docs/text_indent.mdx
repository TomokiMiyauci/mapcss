## Basic usage

### Adding a text indent

Use the `indent-{width}` utilities to set the amount of empty space (indentation) that's shown before text in a block.

<Example p="none">
  <div className="bg-white p-8 shadow-xl text-slate-700 max-w-md mx-auto overflow-auto leading-6 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <p className="indent-8">So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was
      terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers
      a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention
      or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment,
      I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.</p>
  </div>
</Example>

```html
<p className="**indent-8**">
  So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was
  terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers
  a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention
  or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment,
  I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
</p>
```

### Using negative values

To use a negative text indent value, prefix the className name with a dash to convert it to a negative value.

```html
<div className="**-indent-8**">
  So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to...
</div>
```
