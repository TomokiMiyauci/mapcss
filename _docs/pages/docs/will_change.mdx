## Basic usage

### Optimizing with will change

Use `will-change-scroll`, `will-change-contents` and `will-change-transform` to optimize an element that's expected to change in the near future by instructing the browser to prepare the necessary animation before it actually begins.

```html
<div className="overflow-auto **will-change-scroll**">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
