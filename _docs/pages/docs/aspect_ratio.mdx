## Basic usage

### Setting the aspect ratio

Use the `aspect-{ratio}` utilities to set the desired aspect ratio of an element.

<Example resizable>
  <iframe
    className="w-full aspect-video rounded-lg shadow-lg"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</Example>

```html
<iframe
  className="w-full **aspect-video** ..."
  src="https://www.youtube.com/..."
></iframe>
```

Tailwind doesn't include a large set of aspect ratio values out of the box since it's easier to just use arbitrary values. See the [arbitrary values](#arbitrary-values) section for more information.

### Browser support

The `aspect-{ratio}` utilities use the native `aspect-ratio` CSS property, which was not supported in Safari until version 15. Until Safari 15 is popularized, Tailwind's [aspect-ratio](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-aspect-ratio) plugin is a good alternative.
